## Work Experience
**Bioinformatics Research Assistant | Institut Teknologi Bandung (_Jan 2024–Aug 2025_)**
- Developed and optimized an RNA-seq pipeline for differential gene expression analysis, reducing runtime by ~15% while maintaining rigorous QC standards.
- Led microbiome analysis of 200+ nasopharyngeal samples (QIIME2, MetaPhlAn), identifying 2 novel microbial biomarkers linked to respiratory health, with findings submitted for publication.
- Engineered and tested cloud-based scalable workflows using Nextflow, enabling efficient processing of 10TB+ genomic datasets.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams (biologists, medical doctor) to translate data into insights, presenting results in lab meetings and co-authoring manuscripts.

**Research Intern | PT. Berikan Bahari Indonesia (_Dec 2022–Oct 2023_)**
- Conducted multiple trials to improve the color of fish protein hydrolysate with senior researcher of the company.
- Conducted research on fish fermentation to improve the aroma of fish protein hydrolysate.
- Analyzed the efficacy of various antimicrobial agents towards the shelf-life of liquid fish protein hydrolysate and fish oil.
